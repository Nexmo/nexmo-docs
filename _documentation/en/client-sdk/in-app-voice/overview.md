# In-App Voice Overview

Client SDK allows you to add voice capabilities to your web or native application. You application would then be able to support a variety of use cases such as click to call a support agent, realtime messaging, and voice chat rooms.

Client SDK In-App Voice uses WebRTC and includes all the essentials you need to build a feature-rich voice experience.

* 1:1 or Group Calls
* Audio Controls â€“ Mute, earmuff
* DTMF Support

Client SDK In-App Voice integrates with the Nexmo Voice API which amplifies the In-App Voice offering through extra functionality such as:

* Calls to phones (PSTN)
* Calls to SIP-enabled devices
* Connection to other services over Websockets
* Call management
* Complex call flow configurations
* Voice stream recording
* Conference calling
* Text-to-speech messages in 23 languages

The Android and iOS Client SDKs additionally offer:

* Network Change Handling
* Audio Routing Management
* Push Notifications

## Voice calls

There are two ways to make Voice calls:

1. Using VAPI using the Client SDK `callServer()` method.
2. Using peer-peer call functionality via the `inAppCall()` method.

The Client SDK application manages the [Event flow](/conversation/guides/event-flow) of the conversation.
