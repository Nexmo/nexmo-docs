# Nexmo cURL Examples

This repository is a collection of things you can do with [Nexmo's](https://nexmo.com) APIs, all shown with cURL.

## Pre-requisites

You will need [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) installed.

You can either directly edit the `config.sh` file and add in your configuration values, or you can create a `config.local.sh` file, which will override the main config file.

If you don't already have a Nexmo account, you'll need one! You can find the API key and secret for your configuration settings on the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).

## Run the code snippets

As each example requires the aforementioned config files, you must run them from the directory they reside in, for example:

```
cd messaging/sms/
./send-an-sms.sh
```

## Get in touch
