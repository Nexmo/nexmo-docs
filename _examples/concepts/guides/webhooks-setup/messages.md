description: Setting the webhooks for the Messages and Dispatch APIs
---

There are two webhooks supported by the Messages and Dispatch APIs, the Message Status webhook and the Inbound Message webhook. Message status is inbound on the Message Status webhook and the Message itself is received on the Inbound Message webhook. Setting these webhooks is described in detail in the topic [Configuring webhooks for Messages and Dispatch APIs](/messages/code-snippets/configure-webhooks).
