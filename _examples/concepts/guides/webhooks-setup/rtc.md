An [Application](/application/overview) can receive RTC events via the [RTC webhook](/application/overview#webhooks). 

You set the URL of the RTC event webhook when you [create the application](/application/code-snippets/create-application) using your language of choice.

More information on creating an application with RTC capabilities can also be found in the [Application API documentation](https://developer.nexmo.com/api/application.v2#createApplication).
